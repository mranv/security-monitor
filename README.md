Here's how to prompt me effectively for generating different components of the security monitoring toolkit:

1. For Core Components:
```
Generate the [component name] implementation with focus on [specific focus]. Include:
- Core functionality
- Error handling
- Security considerations
- Platform-specific adaptations
```

2. For Platform-Specific Collectors:
```
Create the collector implementation for [macOS/Linux] focusing on:
- [specific monitoring aspect (e.g., process, network, files)]
- Integration with [platform-specific API]
- Event handling
- Security context collection
```

3. For Analysis Components:
```
Implement the security analysis module for [specific threat type] with:
- Detection rules
- Pattern matching
- Event correlation
- Alert generation
```

4. For Specific Features:
```
Add [feature name] functionality to the security monitor:
- Implementation details
- Integration points
- Configuration options
- Usage examples
```

5. For Complete System Components:
```
Generate a comprehensive implementation of [component] including:
- File structure
- Core implementation
- Platform-specific code
- Integration tests
- Documentation
```

Examples of specific prompts:

1. Process Monitoring:
```
Implement process monitoring for [platform] with:
- Process creation/termination tracking
- Command-line argument capture
- Parent-child relationship tracking
- Security context collection
```

2. Network Security:
```
Create network security monitoring for:
- Connection tracking
- DNS monitoring
- Protocol analysis
- Network anomaly detection
```

3. File System Monitoring:
```
Generate file system security monitoring with:
- File access tracking
- Integrity monitoring
- Permission change detection
- Sensitive file monitoring
```

4. Threat Detection:
```
Implement threat detection for [specific threat] including:
- Detection rules
- Pattern matching
- Behavioral analysis
- Alert generation
```

Key aspects to specify in prompts:
1. Target platform(s)
2. Specific security aspects
3. Integration requirements
4. Performance considerations
5. Output format needs

When you're ready to generate specific components, just use these prompt structures and I'll help implement them!
